	<p class="lead">United Russia is the ruling political party of the Russian Federation. United Russia is the largest party in Russia and as of 2018 it holds 335 of the 450 seats in the State Duma.</p>
	
	<p class="lead">The United Russia party formed in December 2001 through a merger of the Unity and the Fatherland – All Russia parties. As of 2017, the United Russia party supports the policies of the presidential administration. Although the United Russia party's popularity declined from its peak of 64.4% in the 2007 Duma elections to 49.32% in the 2011 elections, it remained the most popular party in the country ahead of the second-placed Communist Party at 19.19%. In the 2016 elections, it received 54.2% while the second-place Communist Party received 13.3%.</p>

	<p class="lead">The party has no coherent ideology, but it embraces specific politicians and officials with a variety of political views who support the administration. The party appeals mainly to non-ideological voters, therefore United Russia is often classified by political scientists as a "catch-all party" or as a "party of power". In 2009, it proclaimed <a href="file:///C:/Users/пк/Desktop/Енфарматекаб/CR.html">Centre-right politics</a> politics as its official ideology.</p>
